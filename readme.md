# Excalibur Benchmark Tooling

Deterministic, headless performance scenarios for [Excalibur](https://excaliburjs.com) plus a CLI that runs them against
two engine builds and compares the results. Used by the Excalibur CI to compare every branch against the latest npm release.

## How it works

- `harness/` is a static page that loads an Excalibur **UMD bundle** (`build/dist/excalibur.js`) at runtime via `?engine=<url>`,
  so the same scenarios run against any engine version. It exposes `window.__bench.runTest(name, { mode })`.
- Each scenario in `harness/tests/` builds a scene with a seeded `ex.Random(1337)` and only uses APIs that exist in older
  releases too (feature detect if you need something newer).
- **Step mode (default, used in CI)**: the engine clock is swapped for a test clock before start and driven manually,
  every sample is the wall clock time of one engine step (`update` + `draw`) of `stepMs` simulated time. Reproducible and
  independent of vsync.
- **Realtime mode** (manual): the engine runs on its normal clock for 10s and fps is sampled every 250ms, like the original tool.
- `bench.mjs run` opens a fresh headless Chromium page per (engine, test, repetition) and **interleaves** baseline and
  candidate runs so machine drift hits both sides equally. It writes a `results.json`, prints a table and can write
  SVG charts (per-frame timings for both engines, plus a median summary).

## Usage

```bash
npm ci
npm run build                       # builds the harness page into harness/dist

# compare a local excalibur build against the latest npm release
node bench.mjs run \
  --candidate ../excalibur/build/dist/excalibur.js \
  --baseline npm:excalibur@latest \
  --repeat 3 --out results/results.json --charts results/charts

# re-render a report from a results file (markdown for GitHub job summaries / PR comments)
node bench.mjs report results/results.json --markdown --warn 20 --charts results/charts

node bench.mjs list                 # scenario names
node bench.mjs run ... --tests stack-realistic-300-settle,arcade-1000-bouncing --headed
```

Engine specs accepted by `--candidate`/`--baseline`: a path to a UMD bundle, `npm:<package spec>` (fetched with
`npm pack` into `.engines/`), or an `http(s)://` URL.

### Software vs hardware GL

By default Chromium runs with `--gl swiftshader` (software rendering): deterministic and the only option on GitHub hosted
runners, but drawing heavy scenarios are ~40x slower than a real GPU (2000 bunnies: ~130ms/frame vs ~3ms). Relative
deltas between two engines are still meaningful, absolute numbers are not. On a dev machine with a display use
`--gl hardware --headed` for real GPU numbers:

```bash
node bench.mjs run --candidate ../excalibur/build/dist/excalibur.js --baseline npm:excalibur@latest --gl hardware --headed --tests bunnymark-2000,bunnymark-5000
```

`--headed` also presents every frame on screen (the step loop otherwise never yields to the compositor, so a headed
window would look frozen until a test finishes); the yield is outside the timed window so samples are unaffected, the
run just takes longer. The buttons on the interactive page do the same.

Drawing scenarios set `syncGpu: true` so the GPU finishes each frame inside the timed window (WebGL submits work
asynchronously; without the sync the timer would only see the CPU side).

Interactive page: `npm run dev` then open `http://localhost:5173/?engine=/@fs/<absolute path>/build/dist/excalibur.js`
(or any URL serving a bundle), pick a test and mode, and charts are rendered inline.

## Scenarios

| Name | What it stresses |
|---|---|
| `actors-1000`, `actors-4000` | ECS/transforms/renderer: non-colliding actors flying around (the original benchmark) |
| `stack-realistic-300-settle` | 300 boxes falling into a pile, realistic solver with 3 substeps (narrowphase, solver, islands) |
| `stack-realistic-300-rest` | the same pile fully asleep: per frame floor of broadphase, contact persistence, collider bookkeeping |
| `arcade-1000-bouncing` | 1000 active boxes bouncing in a box, arcade solver, no gravity (broadphase/narrowphase at high pair counts) |
| `edge-floor-realistic-200` | 200 boxes landing along a 4000px edge collider, including its ends (polygon vs edge SAT path) |
| `sleeping-pile-wake` | a sleeping 200 box pile hit by a new box every 60 frames (sleep/wake cycle, contact persistence) |
| `bunnymark-2000`, `bunnymark-5000` | drawing pipeline only: port of [excalibur-bunnymark](https://github.com/excaliburjs/excalibur-bunnymark), sprites drawn straight through the graphics context |

Extras reported next to timings (e.g. `sleepingAtEnd`, `firstFrameAllAsleep`, `fellThrough`, `outside`) double as
sanity checks that the scenario behaved the same on both engines.

## Adding a scenario

Create `harness/tests/<name>.ts` with `defineTest({...})` (see `harness/test.ts` for the options: `stepMs`, `frames`,
`warmup`/`warmupUntil`, `engineOptions`, `setup`, `onFrame`, `extras`) and add it to `harness/tests/index.ts`.
Keep the scene deterministic (use `ctx.rng`) and stick to APIs available in the baseline release.

## Reading results

Deltas are candidate vs baseline medians of the median run; negative is faster. Shared CI runners are noisy: treat single
runs as informational and look for changes that persist across runs. Results with an `error` mean the scenario threw
on that engine (usually an API difference), the table marks them.

Historical reports from the original tool live in `benchmarks/`.
